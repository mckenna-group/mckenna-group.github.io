	  <h1>Research overview</h1>
		<p>The McKenna Materials Modelling Group is based in the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/physics">Department of Physics</a> at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk">University of York</a>. Our research is unified under the general theme "modelling the properties of surfaces and interfaces". In recent work we have focused on nanometre sized and nano-structured systems, such as nanoparticles, nanopowders and thin film heterostructures, which possess unique properties (e.g. electronic, magnetic, optical and chemical) and have wide-ranging applications in fields such as electronics, catalysis, energy and medicine. There is constant demand for improved functionality of these systems and theoretical
modelling plays a vital role. We address these problems, in close collaboration with experiment, by developing and employing a range of multi-scale theoretical and computational techniques to model the relevant conditions (i.e. temperature and pressure) and characteristic scales (e.g. time and length) relevant to real applications. More information on some of our main research areas can be found below.</p>

           <img src="images/poly-mat.jpg" />
            <p>Polycrystalline materials are common in nature and find applications in many different areas of science and technology. Grain boundary defects (i.e. interfaces between crystal grains) play a key role in determining many materials properties but are in many cases poorly understood. To help address this important problem we are developing first-principles based computational methods to predict the atomic-scale structure and properties of grain boundary defects. Working closely with experimental collaborators (Prof. Ikuhara, Univ. Tokyo) we have helped reveal the structure of grain boundaries in a wide range of materials (including MgO, HfO<sub>2</sub>, Si and TiO<sub>2</sub>) with relevance to applications in microelectronics, spintronics, catalysis, surface science and electron transport in solar cell materials.</p>

	    <img src="images/oxide-elec.jpg" />
            <p>Metal-oxide materials are at the heart of a number of current and emerging device technologies with applications in areas such as logic, data storage, optoelectronics and sensing. Atomic-scale defects in oxide materials are often detrimental to performance but in some cases can be essential for realising functionality. We are developing and applying approaches to predict the properties and dynamics of defects in oxide materials in order to drive improvements in device performance. For example, in recent work we have helped understand the resistive switching effect in HfO<sub>2</sub> which can be used for a non-volatile and energy-efficient memory technology. We are also investigating the role of defects in oxides such as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MgO with relevance to spintronic device applications.</p>

          <h2 class="first-header">Electron trapping</h2>
             <img src="images/e-trap.jpg" />
          <p>In many materials atomic-scale defects such as vacancies, interstitials and impurities are able to trap electrons and therefore play a critical role in determining electronic, chemical and optical properties. In materials with large electron-phonon coupling electrons can even self-trap in the perfect lattice forming small polarons. Such effects underpin a range of fundamental and applied issues including superconductivity, magnetism, electron transport in semiconductors and photocatalysis. We are employing a range of self-interaction corrected quantum-mechanical approaches to accurately model electron and hole trapping in nanostructured materials (including surfaces and interfaces).</p>

          <h2 class="first-header">Oxide nanopowders</h2>
	<img src="images/nanopowder.jpg" /> 
          <p>Metal oxide nanopowders comprising a porous network of interconnected nanocrystals represent an interesting class of system with broad applications in chemistry, energy materials, sensing and optical materials. In a long-running collaboration (Prof. Diwald, Univ. Salzburg) we have helped to understand the electronic and optical properties of MgO nanopowders and investigated means to modify them in a controlled way via doping. Our studies have helped elucidate the role of nanocrystal interfaces as charge trapping and luminescence sites and demonstrated the potential of doped MgO nanopowders as luminescent materials for solid state lighting.</p>

      <div class="grid_4">
          <h2 class="first-header">Dynamic nanoparticles</h2>
           <img src="images/dynamic-np.jpg" /> 
          <p>Dynamical interactions between nanoparticles and surrounding molecules can induce both overall morphology transformations and atomic scale fluctuations in their structure. As a consequence properties (optical, electronic and chemical, for example) can be significantly different from those predicted by simple models. This is important for numerous technological applications in areas such as catalysis, gas sensing, and drug delivery, and also for the interpretation of fundamental studies in nanotechnology. We are developing computational approaches to model these effects and recent work has demonstrated how gold naoparticles can be reshaped by adsorption of carbon monoxide molecules.</p>
